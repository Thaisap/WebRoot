<h3 id="idea"> My Idea for a mobile application is based on Coronavirus. The idea is to combine sensors where it checks the
    user temperature. In that way the user can show to concerned people that his healthy conditions are good.
    The sensor that I have in mind your be facial recognition, thermometer sensor and gps sensor</h3>

            </a><br /> Facial recognition is a new technology that was released last year by Apple on the 2018 Iphones.
            This software uses a biometric software application to identify the user by analysing the features on their face.
            The idea of  face recognition on my project is to identify the user and keep its data correctly. The thing that strikes
            me the most is that this feature can "analyses multiple parts of your face, including the placement of your eyes and the
            width of your nose, and combines all these features into a unique code that identifies you".

            The thermometer sensor comes inside of most of smartphones and It monitors the temperature inside the device and battery. If the
            mobile overheat the system shuts down. The Idea of this thermometer is to measure people temperature by using a biometric as
            fingerprint or facial recognition.

            The GPS sensor is very well known and it is found in most of mobile devices. GPS stands for Global Positioning System
             and communicate with satellites to determine our precise location on Earth. The idea of having this sensor is to keep
            track of the places that the user was and this will help detect the places and people that the user got contact with it<br />
